# Debian packaging from null to hello

This repository is a guide for packaging software for Debian-based Linux distributions. It's basically a slimmed-down version of https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/Intro.

By following steps 1 to N, you'll get a binary package suitable for direct installation.

By continuing on through steps N to M, you'll get a binary package suitable for upload to a package archive such as those provide by [Launchpad PPAs](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/en/latest/user/reference/packaging/ppas/ppa/) for Ubuntu.

The repository starts off with pretty much nothing except this README and a single script file, `hello-packaging`. You'll be adding everything needed to package and install that script.
